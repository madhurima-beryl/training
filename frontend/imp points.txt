Why use Sass syntax and import?
Using this syntax can help optimise the performance of your website by compiling the CSS into one file that is served to the browser.
CSS has an import option that lets you split your CSS into smaller, more maintainable portions. The only drawback is that each time you use @import in CSS it creates another HTTP request. Sass builds on top of the current CSS @import but instead of requiring an HTTP request, Sass will take the file that you want to import and combine it with the file you're importing into so you can serve a single CSS file to the web browser.

In the <head> … </head> section we can discover the page title tag, and two other elements of interest: stylesheet_link_tag and javascript_include_tag are two “Asset Tag Helpers”. Note that in total 6 asset tag helpers exist in Rails, they exist to generate HTML that link views to feeds, JavaScript, stylesheets, images, videos and audios.
