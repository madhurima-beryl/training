FEATURES

Ruby language has many features. Some of them are explained below:

1. open-source
2. interpreted programming language
3. Object-oriented	:	Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class
4. Flexibility		:	You can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it

5. Mixins		:	Single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead,
				a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to
				inheritance but much more flexible.

6. Visual appearance	:	Generally prefers English keyword. It doesn't need variable declaration.

7. Dynamic typing and Duck typing :	(dynamic) All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.
					(duck)Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object.
					duck typing focuses on what the object can do and static typing focuses on what the object is.
					try-before-you-buy logic i.e.(“If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it is a duck.”)
8. Exception handling
9. Garbage collector
10.Portable
11.Keywords		:	42 keywords which can't be used for other purposes. They are called reserved words.


12.Statement delimiters	:	Multiple statements in a single line must contain semi colon in between but not at the end of a line.

13.Variable constants	:	Constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will 
				simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.

14.Naming conventions	:


15.Keyword arguments
16.Method names
17.Singleton methods
18.Missing method
19.Case Sensitive

RUBY INSTALLATION

$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full

To see the version:- ruby -v

ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [i686-linux]

------------------------------------------------------------

INTERACTIVE RUBY

In shell type :  $irb  

2.3.1 :001 > "hello world"
 => "hello world" 

2.3.1 :002 > puts "hello world"
hello world
 => nil

puts 		:	basic command to print something out in Ruby
=> nil		:	the result of the expression
puts always returns nil, which is Ruby’s absolutely-positively-nothing value.


*****about nil*******************

2.3.1 :001 > if nil		The code contained within the if is not run, as nil is interpreted as being a false condition.
2.3.1 :002?>   puts "hello"
2.3.1 :003?>   end
 => nil

 false == nil			While both false and nil are both treated as negative when evaluated in an expression, they are not equivalent
 => false 

*****OPERATORS*******************
add			:	+
sub			:	-
mul			:	*
div			:	/
remainder(modulo)	:	%

*****DEFINING METHODS************

def func(name= "madhu")
2.3.1 :007?>   puts "hello #{name}"
2.3.1 :008?>   end
 => :func 
2.3.1 :009 > func
hello madhu
 => nil 

If the name isn’t supplied, use the default name of "madhu"
*****Module example**************

 Math.sqrt(9)
 => 3.0 

Math		:	a built-in module for mathematics.
Dot(.)		:	how you identify the receiver of a message.
sqrt(9)		:	a message which means call the method sqrt, shorthand for “square root” with the parameter of 9.
=>3.0		:	result of this method call is the value 3.0 ( sqrt() always returns a floating-point number)
 Math also contains methods like sin() and tan().

 a= 3**2
 => 9 
 b= 4**3
 => 64 
 Math.sqrt(a+b)
 => 8.54400374531753 


 Modules serve two roles in Ruby.
1.  grouping similar methods together under a familiar name
2.
